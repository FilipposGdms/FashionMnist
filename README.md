# Soteria Nudge Engine

The Soteria Nudge Engine is a backend service designed to provide safety messages to users based on their mode of transport, time of day, location type, and weather conditions. It is built using FastAPI and MongoDB and runs inside Docker containers for easy deployment.

## Technology Stack

### FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and fast to code with, making it ideal for creating robust and high-performance web APIs.

### MongoDB
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. It is known for its high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.

### Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
